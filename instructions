Laravel image: must implement a alpine docker image, needs to connect to mysql, the root path must retrieve some register from the database to assert database connection. This image must communicate implementing php-fpm with nginx. Optional: The start script must automatic create the migrations and seed if this is not ready and then start the fpm server

Nginx: All the request from the domain devops.test must be attended by the laravel service, except the path /thiio this must proxy to the random http docker image service.

Optional: if the request arrive with other domain this must be redirected to devops.test

Random HTTP Docker Image (Optional): This service must implement a docker compose profile with the name of your prefence. Its importante that docker compose up can start without this random http service, but when you execute docker compose --profile random up now the path /thiio must response the questions

Create a file README.md with the instrucctions of how to run the application.
